# ðŸ©º Healthcare Provider Performance Analysis
                                               
This project focuses on the financial analysis of a UK-based healthcare provider dataset, offering a comprehensive overview of patient billing, treatment costs, service utilization, and departmental performance. These elements are critical for assessing the financial health and operational trends of a healthcare system.

Although the dataset does not identify a specific NHS Trust or hospital, it reflects typical healthcare financial data, making its insights relevant to both public (NHS) and private healthcare sectors. The goal is to derive actionable insights to support informed decision-making in real-world healthcare environments. To facilitate this, three well-designed dashboards were developed:

**Financial Overview Dashboard:** This dashboard provides a high-level view of financial trends and system performance, including billing costs across cities and regions, procedure-specific billing, and departmental financial metrics.

**Temporal Analysis Dashboard:** This dashboard delves into financial data on a granular level, breaking down billing and costs on monthly, weekly, yearly, and quarterly bases for detailed trend analysis.

**Provider Efficiency Dashboard:** This dashboard focuses on the efficiency of healthcare providers and service types, highlighting operational performance and resource utilization.
These dashboards collectively enable a robust understanding of the healthcare systemâ€™s financial and operational dynamics, supporting strategic decision-making.

This project uses data I obtained through the YouTube channel DataWithDecision365 to carry out a detailed project
